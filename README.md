# Linear-Dynamical-Model-RLC-Circuits
Modeling and simulation of RC, RL, and RLC circuits as discrete-time linear dynamical systems. Uses state-space representation to analyze how R, L, and C influence circuit behavior. Includes design and tuning of RLC circuits as a 440 Hz resonator, an 84 Hz sensor, and an audio filter.
